# PokemonApp

Pokemon have magically come to life and are running rampant across the globe! Park Rangers
have collected extensive data on each Pokemon and need a way to present and share it with
everyone.
We build a web application that allows users to browse through the pokemon and view
details on each. 

This app use a React app that calls into a C# API.
